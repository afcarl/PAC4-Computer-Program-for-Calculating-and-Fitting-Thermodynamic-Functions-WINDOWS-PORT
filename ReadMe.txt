PAC4: Computer Program for Calculating and Fitting Thermodynamic Functions (WINDOWS-PORT)
==========================================================================================

Program Capabilities:

The PAC4 computer program is described which (1) calculates thermodynamic functions (heat capacity, enthalpy, entropy, and Gibbs energy) for several optional forms of the partition function, (2) fits these function to empirical equations by means of a least-squares fit, and (3) calculates, as a function of temperature, heats of formation and equilibrium constants. The program provides several methods for calculatig idealgas properties.
